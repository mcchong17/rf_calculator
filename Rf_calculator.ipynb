    "Upload an image of your TLC plate by entering the file name of the image of your TLC plate, showing the solvent front and baseline with the spots circled in pencil/pen. The Rf values of the spots will automatically be calculated and shown in the programme. An image of the analysed plate, showing the Rf values of each spot will be save in the same file as the orginal input image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: The programme only works for UV-visualised TLC plates and TLC plates with coloured spots. NOT stain-visualised plates. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the Rf value is calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{f}\\ {value} = \\frac{Distance\\ travelled\\ by\\ the\\ compound}{Distance\\ travelled\\ by\\ the\\ solvent\\ front} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image requirements:\n",
    "* Accepted image formats: **.jpg**, **.jpeg**, **.png**, **.tiff**, and **.tif**.\n",
    "* Image file size must be between 150 kB to 10 MB.\n",
    "* The TLC plate must be on a dark contrasting background for programme to work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of a good image input:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"display_image2_after.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 250px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*To make spot detection easier and more accurate, circle around the oval spot outlines, as shown in example.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of the output image:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src =\"display_image2_after_analysed.jpg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 200px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
